              Here are ten things about the president known affectionately as
              Jokowi:
            </h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Born in 1961, Mr Joko grew up in the Central Java city of Solo
                  as the eldest of four children. As a boy, he helped his
                  carpenter father collect and cut wood, which the family sold
                  as part of their living. He rode to school on a green Yamaha
                  motorbike loaned from his uncle.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  After graduating with a forestry degree from one of the
                  country's top universities, Gadjah Mada, in 1985, Mr Joko set
                  up a business supplying wood flooring, before settling into
                  manufacturing furniture. "My first exports were to Singapore,"
                  he said. He successfully ran for mayor in Solo, a town in
                  central Java, in 2005 and in 2012.

              <li>
                <p>
                  It was his performance as the mayor of Solo that first gained
                  him attention with his ability to resolve issues like floods,
                  dirty streets and slums. By 2012, he was elected the governor
                  of Jakarta, making him a contender for presidency.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>

                  He got his nickname "Jokowi" during his days as a furniture
                  exporter. A furniture buyer from France, once sent him an
                  order meant for another Joko, and started calling him
                  "Jokowi", to avoid future mix-ups.

                  prefers clothes that are comfortable and practical, and was
                  often seen in plain white or red-and-blue checked shirts

                  just be myself," she told media after her husband's
                  presidential victory, adding that she had never compared

                  justice," he once said. "The beat of the drum - boom, boom -
                  gives me spirit."
